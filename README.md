# Deep-Learning
These notebooks were carried out as part of my first year of master at Eurecom, during the Deep Learning class.  
They aimed at applying on concrete cases the methods seen during class.
These projects were realised in team with yasserben. (link of his github here : https://github.com/yasserben)
